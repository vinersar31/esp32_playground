## üî¥ LED (Light Emitting Diode)

A **LED** is a special type of **diode** ‚Äî an electronic component that allows current to flow in only one direction, much like a **one-way street**.

### ‚úÖ How It Works:
- LEDs have **two terminals (pins)**:
  - The **longer pin** is the **positive (+)** (anode)
  - The **shorter pin** is the **negative (-)** (cathode), which connects to **GND** (ground)
- A LED **only lights up** when the current flows from the positive (+) to the negative (-) terminal.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: LEDs typically operate safely between **1.9V and 3.4V**. Supplying more than **3.3V without protection** can **damage or burn out** the LED.

### ‚ùó Never Connect a LED Directly to Power:
To protect the LED, always use a **resistor in series**. This limits the current and prevents damage.

## üü° Resistor

A **resistor** is a **passive component** that limits or controls the flow of current in a circuit. It is measured in **Ohms (Œ©)**.

### Resistance Units:
- **1 kŒ©** = 1,000 Œ©  
- **1 MŒ©** = 1,000 kŒ© = 1,000,000 Œ©

### Symbol and Appearance:

- Right: Circuit diagram symbol

### Color Bands:
Resistors use **colored bands** to indicate their resistance values. See the **appendix** for a detailed resistor color code chart.

## ‚ö° Ohm‚Äôs Law

The relationship between **voltage (V)**, **current (I)**, and **resistance (R)** is defined by:

```
I = V / R
```

Where:  
- **I** = Current (Amperes, A)  
- **V** = Voltage (Volts, V)  
- **R** = Resistance (Ohms, Œ©)

### Example Calculation:
If you apply **5V** across a **10 kŒ© resistor**:

```
I = 5V / 10,000Œ© = 0.0005A = 0.5mA
```
